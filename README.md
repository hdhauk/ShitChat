# ShitChat

**A crude and fairly crappy chat server and client, made for an assignment in TTM4100.**

### Installation
In both folders `sc-client` and `sc-server` do a  `go install .`

### How to run
1. Start the server: `sc-server -port <your port>`
2. Start the client: `sc-client -server <ip:port to your server>`
